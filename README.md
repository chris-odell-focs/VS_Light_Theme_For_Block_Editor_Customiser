## Using

People like to customise the look of the products they use in life. This theme is an extension to the
Foxdell Folio Block Editor Customiser, and requires the Block Editor Customiser to run. The theme changes
the colours of the Block Editor Customiser to a light purple colour, and was inspired by the 'Light' theme
in Visual Studio Code.

* Download the "Foxdell Folio BEC VS Light Theme" plugin from WordPress.org
* Unzip the package and move to your plugins directory.
* Log into WordPress and navigate to the Plugins screen.
* Locate "Foxdell Folio BEC Vs Light Theme" in the list and click the Activate link.
